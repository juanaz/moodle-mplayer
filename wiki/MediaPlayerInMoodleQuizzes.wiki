#summary How to display video in Moodle quizzes with the Media Player module.

This page gives a brief description of how to include instances of the Media Player module in Moodle quizzes but it is equally applicable to any Moodle pages where it's possible to create HTML objects.

----

== How it works ==

This is a simple hack that only requires a small snippet of HTML code to embed video in a Moodle quiz using an iFrame.

----

== How to do it ==

  # Create a Media Player instance anywhere in a Moodle course and make a note (or copy) of the player instance URL, e.g. `http://localhost/moodle/mod/mplayer/view.php?id=26`
  # In the same curse, create a quiz module instance
  # Create a question in the question bank where you want the video to be displayed
  # While editing the question, turn the HTML editor on and include the following HTML code in the page:
{{{
<iframe src="http://localhost/moodle/mod/mplayer/embed.php?id=26" width="100%" height="400" >
<p>Your browser does not support frames</p>
</iframe>
}}}

Please note that the URL has been changed from:
{{{
http://localhost/moodle/mod/mplayer/view.php?id=26
}}}
to
{{{
http://localhost/moodle/mod/mplayer/embed.php?id=26
}}}
The "embed.php" page is a simplified version of view.php that has had the navigation menus removed.

The iframe height parameter should be about 50 pixels greater than the height of the Media Player video instance height parameter.
