Installing the Media Player Activity Module plugin is a short, simple process:

  # Download the latest version of the [http://code.google.com/p/moodle-mplayer/downloads/list Media Player here]
  # Unzip the package and upload its contents to `MOODLE/mod/mplayer`
  # Check that your mplayer directory isn't "double skinned", i.e. `MOODLE/mod/mplayer/mplayer`
  # Login to Moodle and go to Administration > Notifications
  # The Media Player Activity Module will install
  # That's it.

If you experience any problems, such as a blank screen or error messages immediately after installation/upgrade, try this:

  # Go to Administration > Modules > Activities > Media Player
  # (Optional) Adjust any site wide Media Player module settings
  # Save Changes

This will prevent any empty parameter values from being passed on the the Media Player module and triggering errors.
