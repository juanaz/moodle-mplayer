There are two parameters:

  * *Bitmap* - There are two options `true` (default) takes the snapshot of the video frame and sends it to the server-side script or `false` sends frame position data to a server-side script which can then extract the frame there (this script is not supplied).
  * *Script* - The server-side script that saves the snapshot on the server.

== How to configure ==

The Snapshot plugin will not work "out of the box", it requires a little configuration.

=== How it works ===

The moodle/mod/mplayer/scripts/snapshot.php script is configured to save video snapshots in the course files directory, in a folder called `/snapshots/`, in a sub-folder with the users' ID as the name, e.g. `snapshots/1/` would be for a guest user, `snapshots/2/` would most probably be the site administrator and `snapshots/3/`, `snapshots/4/`, etc. would be other users. If a user's directory does not exist in the course files directory, the script cannot save the snapshot image and will return an error. In this way, it is possible to control exactly who can and can't save snapshots on a user by user, course by course basis.

=== Setting up a snapshots directory for a user ==

  # On the desired Moodle course, go to: People > Participants and a list of user for that course will appear
  # Click on a user's name to go to their profile page
  # In the browser address bar you should see something like: `http://example.com/user/view.php?id=4&course=13` (`id=4` is the user ID and `course=13` is the course ID)
  # On the course page, go to Administration > Files
  # Click on "Make a folder" and name it `snapshots`
  # Inside the `snapshots` folder, make another folder and call it `4` (the user ID number)
  # That's it. User '4' can now save video snapshots using the Snapshots plugin.
  # Repeat step 6 for each user that you want to give permission to.

 i.e. moodledata/[course ID]/snapshots/[user ID]/
