The Livestream plugin checks for the start of a live video broadcast every few seconds. It is useful because users don't have to keep refreshing the web page to see if the broadcast has begun.

----

There are six parameters:

  * *RTMP Stream* - Name or ID of live video broadcast to keep checking
  * *Image* - A poster image to display at the end of the live video broadcast
  * *Interval* - Number of seconds between checking for the video (smaller time intervals will put unnecessary strain on your server
  * *Message* - Text to display while Livestream is checking for the live broadcast to begin
  * *Streamer* - RTMP Media server that broadcasts the live video
  * *Tags (advanced)* - See [http://developer.longtailvideo.com/trac/wiki/PluginsLivestream JW FLV Player Livestream] documentation
