The Audio Description plugin synchronises an MP3 audio file with the video. It has a variety of uses including Section 508 accessibility, multilingual support, voice-overs, etc.

----

== How to use ==

The 3 parameters are:

  * MP3 File - The MP3 audio that you want to synchronise with the video
  * Auto Start - Start playing audio immediately (there's currently a bug in this)
  * Volume - Volume of the MP3 audio (independent of the video audio)

  # Click on the "Choose or upload a file..." button
  # Select the MP3 audio file you want to synchronise with the video
  # Set the Auto Start and Volume parameters as desired

Please note: Users can switch the Audio Description on and off as desired. If you want to replace the video audio, set the video volume to 0.
